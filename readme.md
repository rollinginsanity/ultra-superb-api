What the hell is this thing?
============================

The aim is for this to eventually be a deliberatly vulnerable API, implementing some of your favorite OWASP Top 10.

At the moment it's still early days, and doesn't really do much.


Requirements
============

* Python 3.5+
* Virtualenv
* Pip

To run:

Run create_db.py if you haven't already (builds the DB)

Run start.py to kick things off
